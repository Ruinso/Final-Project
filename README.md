# Final-Project
Starbucks Shift Manager
The program I am submitting for my final project is a Starbucks Shift Builder that has many possibilities outside of the code I have submitted.
The program has a basic menu that allows the user to utilize the various functions built in the program.
It uses maps and a custom class vector to hire staff, assign that staff roles, keep track of the staff, fire the staff, clockout an entire shift, build a new shift and display the currently hired staff.
I had a lot of fun with this project and I will probably work on it some more and fully flesh it out over winter break.
It is fully baked and working however the maps do not contain custom objects as I was getting errors when using my Employee class.
The code is not as effecient as it should be but this is the best I can do given the time frame. 
Fairly barebones but a good launch point for a fully function text-based "Starbucks Simulator"
